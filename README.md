# snac.py

if you are someone who wishes to use mastodon from terminal, you will be better with [toot.py](https://github.com/fireshadow/toot.py).

this is made with specifically keeping snac2 in mind which is currently incompatible with toot.py.

the project is currently in development and my main goal right now is to make things work individually and then combine it together in tui. i am open to any feedback or suggestions. you may personally reach me out in mail. on fediverse i am at @dharmik@linuxusers.in or you can just make a new issue.

- Features to make work
	- [X] Currently working project in ```snac_client.py```
	- [X] Make posting work
	- [X] Timeline work
	- [ ] Notif work
	- [ ] Fix css
	- [ ] Set up a login workflow that doesn't require setting up the env file.

I am open to any PRs/features you might like to add.
